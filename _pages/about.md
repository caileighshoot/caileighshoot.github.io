I specialize in using remote sensing and GIS to solve problems and answer questions about earth's natural resources. My background includes work with LiDAR, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, and drones/UAVs. I started my career in Remote Sensing as an undergraduate researcher in September 2014, during which time I worked on my capstone under Dr. L. Monika Moskal and Dr. Van Kane. For this project I determined that LiDAR can be used to detect understory presence in the Sugar Pine/Mixed conifer forests of Yosemite National Park. During this time, I was also able to work as a field research assistant in Yosemite.

In June 2018 I completed my Masters of Science in the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory. My MS thesis work involved using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to classify forest type in the Tanana Valley of interior Alaska and was co-chaired by Dr. L. Monika Moskal and Dr. Hans-Erik Andersen. After graduating, I was hired as an intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center wherein I was able to finish the processing of my thesis on the NASA super computer. This work was published in Remote Sensing in May 2021.​
Since 2018 I have worked in forest remote sensing and GIS for the largest forestry company in the US. In that time I have worked as a Remote Sensing Research Specialist, Inventory and Planning GIS Analyst, and now a Forest Carbon Analyst. As a Remote Sensing Research Specialist, I worked to integrate remote sensing into Weyerhaeuser's research projects. This included the use of lidar, multispectral imaging, and especially UAVs. While I was in this role, I logged well over 150 UAV flights, many of which were flown solo. I did all of the flight planning, equipment maintenance, and data processing as part of this work. 

As an inventory and Planning GIS Analyst I performed GIS mapping and spatial analysis in direct support of Weyerhaeuser's operational forestry teams. I also provided user support and training for both ESRI products (such as ArcGIS Desktop, Field Maps, Survey123, and more) as well as Weyerhaeuser's internal forest management systems and databases. 

In the summer of 2022 I was offered a part-time position as a Remote Sensing lecturer at the University of Washington to fill in for a faculty member. With Weyerhaeuser's support, I was able to gladly accept the position and teach 115 students remote sensing part-time (while also working my full-time job at Weyerhaeuser) for an academic quarter. I very much enjoy teaching and was grateful for this opportunity. By the end of the quarter, I was left with very strong course evaluations, earning a 4.1/5 overall (with 71% of students responding to the evaluations). 

In response to the evaluation question, "Was this class intellectually stimulating? Did it stretch your thinking? Why or why not?", students responded with:

> "Yes, I loved all the topics and Caileigh did a great job at presenting it. I really learned a lot about remote sensing. All my other classes that use remote sensing for ecology did not really cover the ideas on how remote sensing does works and focused more on what we can do in the ArcGIS program."

> "Yes this class presented me with a lot of great information about remote sensing and offered me an introduction to this really cool field of study"

> "It definitely got me thinking about real-world applications of the subject matter. Opposed to some other classes where I couldn't think of ways this could be applied to my field, in this class I could see myself doing the coursework in the context of a job."

In response to the evaluation question "What aspects of this class contributed most to your learning?", students responded:

> "Getting to hear from someone who is in the industry and get, what I felt to be, very candid and helpful advice on jobs and what this field looks like. I think that Caileigh did a great job of presenting us the information and her enthusiasm about the content made it even better."

> "Caileigh's ability to teach "with the flow", have good vibes in lecture all around. She was just a fantastic lecturer and really motivated me to keep going with remote sensing"

In my current work as a Forest Carbon Analyst I use data analysis (in Python and R), GIS, and Remote Sensing to aide in the development of forest carbon projects. Since beginning in this role, much of my focus has been in building tools and documentation that will allow us to easily execute on carbon projects. I also build custom code and maps to perform detailed assessments of areas.
